# sys6018-competition-house-prices

Teammates: 
Tyler Lewris (tal3fj)
Sai Prasanth ( .    )

Roles for each teammate: 
Given that we only have two members for this assignment, our roles are flexible and will most likely change throughout the project. Additionally, in terms of specific code, we both collaborated with one another through an iterative process and used the best pieces of eachothers code.

GitHub Coordinator/Team Organizer/Data Cleaner/Parametric: Tyler Lewris
Data Cleaner/Data Exploration/Non Parametric/Code Commenter: Sai Prasanth


GRADING CRITERIA:
Everyone on your team will receive the same grade, which will be assessed on the basis of evidence found for the following key activities:

Data exploration
Data cleaning (missing values, outliers, etc.)
Rationale for the selected statistical modeling methods
Correct implementation and use of statistical modeling methods
Appropriate model selection approach (train/test, cross-validation, etc.)
Thoroughly documented code (R comments)
Appropriate use of functions to reduce code complexity and redundancy

Bonus points will be awarded to the 5 top-ranked teams as follows:

If R <= 5:  Bonus = 10 * (1 / R) 

Otherwise:  Bonus = 0

where R is your team's rank within the class (ignoring submissions by others who are not in the class). The top-ranked team will have R=1 and will thus receive 10 bonus points on this assignment.

Notes:

You have limited competition entries per day. Plan accordingly.
Your Kaggle submission timestamp and your GitHub commit timestamp must both be prior to the assignment due date in order to receive a non-zero score on this assignment.
