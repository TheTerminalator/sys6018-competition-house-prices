#--------------------RATIONALE FOR THE SELECTED STATISTICAL MODELING METHODS-----------

# We focussed on Linear Regression among parametric approaches because we believe that it is a great modelling technique and one that we are very comfortable with. Also, based on the plots we generated, it was apparent to us that most of the variables, the ones that are important had a linear relationship 

# We choose K-NN as our parametric approach since we don't have a lot of important numeric variables. Based on the plots we generated, it seemed like only 4 numeric parameters were important and K-NN, an algrorithm convinient to implement could potentially give us a good answer
